# TicTacToeSlashCommand
Slack Project

To play a game, follow these steps in order:
1) /ttt vs <user> : invite a user to play
2) /ttt yes/no    : accept/decline invitation
3-11) /ttt 1-9    : play TicTacToe

Game refreshes every two minutes at the 0,2,4,6, and 8 minute marks (12:00, 12:02...)
Be sure you look at the clock so that you don't get kicked off mid-game!
Also, if you finish before the clock runs out, you'll have to wait until 
02,04,06,08,00 to start a new game.
